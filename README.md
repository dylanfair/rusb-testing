Got inspiration from [WilliamTuominiemi/dualshock4-tester](https://github.com/WilliamTuominiemi/dualshock4-tester/tree/main) to learn more about reading in data from USBs. I was curious about how the data comes through when multiple inputs are pressed at once, and wanted to find a good way to handle them. Currently have a working version that seems to cover all the cases.

Would like to expand this to learning about other USB devices, like mice and keyboards.
